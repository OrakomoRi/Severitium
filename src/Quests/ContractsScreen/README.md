# :sparkles: Contracts Screen

Stylizes the original contract cards.

The peculiarity of the module is that the original html code of contracts is very poor and broken, it contains inline-styles (`<element style="">`), so you have to override them with `!important`.

## :bulb: Single module

You can manually use this component by enabling the [script](https://github.com/OrakomoRi/Severitium/blob/main/src/Quests/ContractsScreen/ContractsScreen.user.js?raw=true) in Tampermonkey.
