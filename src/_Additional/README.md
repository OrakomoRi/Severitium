Returns an object with the extracted file name and its type.

{
	fileName: "icons/logo",
	fileType: "(image)"
}

- The function checks if the given URL contains `/src/.images/` to determine if it refers to an image.
- If it is an image, it extracts the file path within `.images/` and labels it as `"(image)"`.
- Otherwise, it assumes the file is a CSS file and extracts its path, labeling it as `"(CSS)"`.
- If the pattern doesnâ€™t match, it returns `"Unknown"` as the file name and `"(Unknown)"` as the type.

This function is useful for categorizing and handling file types dynamically.
