# :sparkles: Lobby

This is where all the "lobby" elements are stored. All indents were aligned, buttons were typified, and unnecessary empty spaces were removed.

First of all, the emphasis is on the interface alignment. The main color of the theme is used almost everywhere. Also, the buttons have not changed their position relative to each other, so as not to confuse the user who is used to the default location.

The lobby is one of the most important screens in the game. It should be elegant, informative, but not overwhelming. Welcome to the lobby, buddy!
