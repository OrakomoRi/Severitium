# :sparkles: Chat Window

The chat window in the lobby. The mechanism for switching chat channels has been redesigned to get rid of the ugly default `select`. Despite HTML5, `select` still can't be customized and can't have a semi-transparent background color.

## :bulb: Single module

You can manually use this component by enabling the [script](https://github.com/OrakomoRi/Severitium/blob/main/src/Lobby/ChatWindow/ChatWindow.user.js?raw=true) in Tampermonkey.
