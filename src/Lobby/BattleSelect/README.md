# :sparkles: Battle Select

This is where all modules for items and events related to the game type and battle mode selection are stored.

This is the [game type](/src/Lobby/BattleSelect/BattleType/README.md) selection, which opens immediately upon pressing the "play" button. And also a menu for selecting the [battle mode](/src/Lobby/BattleSelect/BattleMode/README.md) for matchmaking (TDM, CTF, ASL, etc.).
